# Ruby Science

The canonical reference for writing fantastic Rails applications from authors
who have created hundreds.

You build web applications, and you love Ruby on Rails because it provides a
framework for developing applications that are are fast, fun, and easy to
change. Over time these applications can become bloated, development slows down,
and changes to the codebase become painful.

Ruby Science helps you learn to detect and fix emerging problems in your
codebase, while maintaining an application that will be fun to work on for years
to come.

This repository includes both the [Markdown source files] for the book, as
well as the companion [example Rails application].
